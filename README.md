# sorting-visualizer
 This Flask web app demonstrates the execution of sorting algorithms (Merge, Insertion, Selection etc.) Users can test algorithms on arrays provided directly, via files, or generated randomly, and compare performance on varying sizes. It features execution time visualizations (bar/line plots), result downloads, and aids in algorithm analysis.
